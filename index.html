        <h2><u>OVERVIEW</u></h2>
        <p font face="Bookman Old Style"> My name is <b>Christopher B. Jonota</b>, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce myself. I am
            currently a 1st year student at Quezon City University at San Bartolome Branch, pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
            <br><br>I've always been interested in technology-related activities, which is what led me to this program in the first place. I feel that by immersing myself in this profession, I will be able to not only broaden my knowledge but also positively contribute to the world around me.
            <br><br>When I'm not studying or working on tasks, you may find me learning new things that will aid me in my daily life. In my spare time, I like playing video games and working out, and these activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
